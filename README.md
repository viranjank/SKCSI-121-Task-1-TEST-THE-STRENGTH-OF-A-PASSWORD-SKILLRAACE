TEST THE STRENGTH OF A PASSWORD
The password strength project aims to develop a password-strength testing tool. It will
provide users with an easy and efficient way to evaluate the strength of their passwords.
The tool will analyze various factors such as length, complexity, and inclusion of special
characters to determine the strength level. Additionally, it will provide suggestions and
tips for creating stronger passwords.
The project will focus on creating a user-friendly interface as a web / Desktop application
and incorporating robust algorithms to assess password strength accurately. Ultimately,
the goal is to enhance cybersecurity awareness and empower users to protect their
accounts with strong passwords.
